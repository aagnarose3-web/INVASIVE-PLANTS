				<h2 style="font-size:40;"><b>LIST OF PLANTS FROM SELECTED AREA</b></h2>
				<div class="plant-card">
				<h3>1.MIKANIA SCANDENS (CLIMPING HEMPWEED)<br> ധ‍ൃതരാഷ്‍ട്ര പച്ച </h3><p style="font-size:40;"><strong>FAMILY:</strong>ASTERACEAE</p>
				<img src="/INVASIVE-PLANTS/mikania.png"alt="PICTURE OF MIKANIA SCANDENS" class="plant-image">
				<p style="font-size:25;">Mikania scandens, or climbing hempweed, is a herbaceous vine native to Eastern North America that is often confused with the invasive Mikania micrantha. While M. scandens can act as a local weed in its native range, it is not considered broadly invasive there and is even endangered in some parts of its native range. Its invasive reputation in places like Hawaii and Southeast Asia is likely due to misidentification with the highly invasive M. micrantha, which is known for its serious environmental and economic impacts</p></div>
				
				<div class="plant-card">
				<h3>2.PANIC GRASS</h3><p><strong>FAMILY:</strong>GRASS FAMILY</p>
				<img src="/INVASIVE-PLANTS/panicum.png"alt="PICTURE OF PANIC GRASS" class="plant-image">
				<p>Different species of panic grass (genus Panicum) have different behaviors; some are native and benign, while others, like torpedo grass (Panicum repens), are aggressively invasive. The invasive species are known for their ability to form dense, sprawling colonies that displace native vegetation, particularly in moist habitats.</p></div>
				
				<div class="plant-card">
				<h3>3.CHROMOLAENA ODORATA (SIAM WEED/COMMUNIST PACHA)</h3><p><strong>FAMILY:</strong>ASTERACEAE</p>
				<img src="/INVASIVE-PLANTS/communist pacha.png"alt="PICTURE OF SIAM WEED" class="plant-image">
				<p>Siam weed is a fast-growing, invasive perennial shrub native to South and Central America that has become a major weed in tropical and subtropical regions .It forms dense, tangled bushes, grows to 1.5–2.5 meters tall, and can climb other vegetation to reach up to 6 meters. Key identifying features include triangular leaves with a distinctive "pitchfork" pattern and small, fragrant, fluffy flowers that are white when young and turn mauve or purple as they mature. It outcompetes native plants, has allelopathic effects (releasing chemicals that inhibit other plants), can cause skin allergies, and its leaves are toxic to cattle. </p></div>
