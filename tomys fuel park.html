				<h2 style="font-size:40;"><b>LIST OF PLANTS FROM SELECTED AREA</b></h2>
				<div class="plant-card">
				<h3>1.MIMOSA DIPLOTRICHA (GIANT SENSITIVE PLANTS)<br>ആനത്തൊട്ടാവാടി</h3><p style="font-size:40;"><strong>FAMILY:</strong>LEGUMINOUS</p>
				<img src="/INVASIVE-PLANTS/aanathottavadi.png"alt="PICTURE OF AANATHOTTAVADI" class="plant-image">
				<p style="font-size:25;">Mimosa diplotricha is a neotropical invasive shrub that forms dense, thorny thickets and spreads aggressively in tropical and subtropical regions. It is known as the giant sensitive plant and smothers native plants by climbing over them, and its sharp, hooked spines make it difficult for animals to graze or penetrate the thickets. This invasive species can negatively impact native ecosystems, agriculture, and biodiversity</p></div>
				
				<div class="plant-card">
				<h3>2.PENNISETUM SETACEUM (CRIMSON FOUNTAIN GRASS)<br>പോതപ്പ‍ുല്ല്</h3><p style="font-size:40;"><strong>FAMILY:</strong>GRASS FAMILY</p>
				<img src="/INVASIVE-PLANTS/pennisetum.jpg"alt="PICTURE OF PENNISETUM GRASS" class="plant-image">
				<p style="font-size:25;">Crimson fountain grass, also known as purple fountain grass is a drought-tolerant,fast growing,perennial bunch grass that is considered invasive in many regions. It forms dense clumps and is known for its plumose, purple-to-crimson-colored flower spikes. Its invasiveness is due to its ability to outcompete native plants for resources, its high seed production, and its tolerance for harsh conditions. </p></div>
				
				<div class="plant-card">
				<h3>3.MUCUNA BRACTEATA (MUCUNA)<br>തോട്ടപ്പയർ</h3><p style="font-size:40;"><strong>FAMILY:</strong>LEGUMINOUS</p>
				<img src="/INVASIVE-PLANTS/thottapayar.png"alt="PICTURE OF THOTTAPAYAR" class="plant-image">
				<p style="font-size:25;">While certain Mucuna species, particularly M. bracteata, are cultivated for benefits like nitrogen fixation, their makes them highly invasive. They can quickly escape cultivation and devastate natural and agricultural ecosystems. This aggressive perennial vine grows rapidly, up to 10–15 centimeters per day. It has deep, strong roots that make it difficult to eradicate completely. The plant can regenerate vigorously even from small root fragments left in the soil. </p></div>
